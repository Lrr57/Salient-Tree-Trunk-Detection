# Tree trunk detection in urban scenes using a multiscale attention-based deep learning method

Rao Li, GuoDong Sun, Sheng Wang, TianZhuzi Tan and Fu Xu

This repository includes the python code of our TrunkNet that were used to detect salient tree trunk and our presented salient-trunk dataset (ST-D).

## Introduction of the TrunkNet

TrunkNet, an end-to-end tree trunk detection deep model, is specifically designed to address the challenges caused by complex tree structures and the occlusion effect. TrunkNet consists of eleven encoder-decoder blocks connected in a Ushaped structure. In each block, global and local information can be captured to facilitate the localization and refinement of trunks, respectively. Additionally, channel attention is leveraged to emphasize feature channels that contain rich textural information, reducing occlusion-related false detection.
